    <!-- Problem Statement -->
    <section id="problem">
        <h2>üö® The Problem CommuneX Solves</h2>
        <br>

        <p>
            Communities are the backbone of society, but managing community-related services, events, and concerns
            remains highly inefficient and fragmented. People often struggle with common issues like finding local
            services, addressing civic concerns, organizing community events, and staying updated with real-time
            changes
            in their locality. The absence of a unified platform creates significant barriers to efficient
            communication
            and collaboration among residents, local authorities, and service providers.
            <br>
            <br>

            One of the biggest challenges communities face is **lack of accessibility to local resources**. Whether
            it‚Äôs
            finding someone for home repairs, volunteering for a social cause, or renting equipment, people often
            have
            to rely on word of mouth, social media groups, or scattered directories, which are neither efficient nor
            reliable.
            <br>
            <br>

            Another key issue is the **difficulty in reporting and resolving local issues**. Potholes, broken
            streetlights, water supply problems, or sanitation issues take time to reach the concerned authorities
            due
            to inefficient reporting mechanisms. Even when reported, tracking the status of these complaints is
            frustrating, leaving residents in the dark about whether their concerns are being addressed.
            <br>
            <br>

            Additionally, **community event management remains a major challenge**. Organizing local events such as
            clean-up drives, blood donation camps, cultural programs, and educational workshops often lacks proper
            coordination. Limited visibility, lack of participant engagement, and poor communication prevent such
            initiatives from reaching their full potential.
            <br>
            <br>

            Another significant problem is **the underutilization of available skills and resources within a
            community**. Many individuals and small businesses offer valuable services but struggle to connect with
            potential customers in their area. A carpenter, tutor, or fitness instructor living nearby may go
            unnoticed
            due to the absence of a dedicated platform for local networking and collaboration.
            <br>
            <br>

            Real-time updates are another missing element in many communities. Whether it's a sudden power outage,
            traffic diversion, or emergency situation, residents often find out about these issues through delayed
            or
            unreliable sources. A centralized system providing live updates could help communities stay informed and
            prepared.

            Security and trust also remain concerns in local dealings. Many people hesitate to hire a service
            provider
            or participate in a community exchange because of trust issues. Without proper verification and feedback
            systems, people are reluctant to engage in local exchanges.
            <br>
            <br>

            Considering all these challenges, there is a clear need for a **comprehensive, real-time, and
            interactive
            platform** that empowers communities to operate more efficiently and collaboratively. This is where
            **CommuneX** comes in.
